# Stock-Predictor-9000
Interactive machine learning-based stock prediction tool.

The purpose of this tool to be a learning experience of some technologies I was eager to try learn - namely machine learning and UI design, as well as somewhat of a homage to my younger self who was, at the time, interested in a career in finance. 


### Prerequisites

- Quandl (`pip install quandl`)
- Sci-Kit Learn (`pip install scikit-learn`)


## Usage example
- Home screen (choose stock from list of tickers)
